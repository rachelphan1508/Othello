Idea of current Minimax:
- Get a copy of the current board
- Get an array of all possible moves from the board
- For each move, get the board AFTER we make the move (failing with boardAfterClicked actually flipping the real CurBoard)
- Evaluate each move by mobility, corner
- Compare score with min/max depends on whether we are at minimizer or maximizer
- Save the move in nextMoves array. Last move in the array is our next move for the bot.
